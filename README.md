# Myntra-Analysis
> A Data Engineering Project to catalogue and analyze products appearing in Myntra's retail store

Hello There 👋!

This project is more on the lines of Data Engineering, Warehousing and Reporting than a Data Analysis or Data Science project. The Dashboard & Pipeline for this are still in the works! However, the Pipeline is almost completed. 🏄‍

> Being built with Dash, Luigi, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic.

## Background
[Myntra's retail store](https://www.myntra.com) offers users to sort their product offering by several options. Some interesting options are "Recommended", "What's New", "Popularity", "Better Discount". This project aims to find out if there could be any relation between the products appearing in these various options. 

Some interesting use cases to focus on would be to 
* Check if a product appearing under "Better Discount" also does appear in "Popularity" in the coming day or weeks?
* Are products recommended by Myntra which appear under "Recommended" also appear in "What's New" or "Popularity"?

etc ...
